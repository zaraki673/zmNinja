Important Notes
---------------
* zmNinja needs APIs enabled in ZoneMinder. If you are running ZM 1.29 or above, APIs should automatically be available. See [this](https://github.com/pliablepixels/zmNinja/wiki/Validating-if-APIs-work-on-ZM) for instructions on how to make sure your APIs are working. If they are not working, zmNinja **will not** work.

Before you ask for help
-----------------------
* Make sure you have read the [FAQ](https://github.com/pliablepixels/zmNinja/wiki/FAQ)
* Make sure you have [validated](https://github.com/pliablepixels/zmNinja/wiki/Validating-if-APIs-work-on-ZM) that your APIs are working (if not, its a ZM issue, please post in ZM forums)
* Please don't ask me for help with source compilation if you are not familiar with coding mobile apps - you should try and solve your own problems


Objective
----------
I wanted to learn how to write a mobile app. It was (and is) fun.
